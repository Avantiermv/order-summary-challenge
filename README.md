## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow

### What I've learned

I learned that it is not necessary to use many divs to move an image. I, for example, used transform: translate;.

### Ongoing development

I'm going to study more about CSS so I don't get stuck in a bug or misalignment for too long. I will also continue studying about JavaScript.
